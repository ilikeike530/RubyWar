# Functionality to add:
# 	Add an end game statement, including
# 					Statement of who the winner was
#           counter " This game took 40 turns.  At 2 seconds per turn, it would have taken
# 							20 minutes to play thisgame
				#   List most and least cards each player had during the game
# 	Add a graphical indicator after each turn to show how many cards are left over for each team, i.e:
#							----------------|---------------------------
# 	Add an automated mode "A" to Automate, "Q" to quit
# 	Add something to make sure the lines line up based on the length of a user's name
# 	Add a delay so the game looks cool and the line moves back and forth
#
