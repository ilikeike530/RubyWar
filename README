This game will simulate the game of war - the card game where each player filps 
the top card and the player with the highest card wins and takes the opponents
card.  If the cards are tied, 3 cards a placed face down, and a 4th face up. The
player with the highest card wins the tie.  If a tie continues, 4 more cards are 
put in play.  While a game of war might not seem like an exciting computer game,
I can assure you that playing the actual game with physical cards is much more 
mind-numbing.
